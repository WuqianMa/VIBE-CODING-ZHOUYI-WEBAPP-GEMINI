# I Ching Release - User Guide

## Introduction
**I Ching Release** is a spiritual tool that bridges ancient Eastern wisdom with modern emotional release techniques. It combines the divination power of the *Zhouyi* (I Ching) with the *Sedona Method* to help you find clarity and let go of emotional burdens.

Unlike traditional I Ching apps that only predict the future, this tool focuses on **your internal state**, helping you release the need for control, approval, or safety that often creates anxiety around your questions.

## How to Use

### 1. Set Your Intention
Open the application. You will see a simple, clean interface prompting you to focus on what burdens your heart.
*   **Select Language:** Use the dropdown in the top right to switch between English, Chinese (中文), or French.

### 2. Ask a Question
Type a specific question or a general topic you are struggling with into the input field.
*   *Examples:* "Should I take this new job?", "Why do I feel blocked in my relationship?", "What do I need to learn right now?"

### 3. Reveal the Hexagram
Click the **"Reveal Hexagram"** button.
*   The app will simulate the ancient Yarrow Stalk method to generate a Hexagram.
*   **Note:** This process takes a few seconds to "calculate" and fetch the interpretation.

### 4. Read the Wisdom
You will be presented with:
*   **Original Hexagram (Ben Gua):** Represents your current situation.
*   **Future Hexagram (Dong Gua):** Represents the potential evolution (if there are moving lines).
*   **Enriched Text:** The ancient decision and commentary texts are provided with Pinyin and modern translations.
*   **The Dialogue:** An AI-generated interpretation that speaks to you like a wise guide, analyzing your specific question against the hexagrams.

### 5. The Release Practice (Crucial Step)
Below the interpretation, you will see the **Release Practice** section.
1.  Click **"Start Release Practice"**.
2.  The app will identify the emotions underlying your question.
3.  Follow the interactive prompts based on the Sedona Method:
    *   *Could you let it go?*
    *   *Would you let it go?*
    *   *When?*
4.  This process is designed to clear the emotional charge, allowing the wisdom of the I Ching to land in a clear mind.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When is the AI used?
The application uses Artificial Intelligence (Google Gemini) **only after** the Hexagram is generated mathematically. The AI does not choose the Hexagram; it acts as a translator and interpreter to explain the result in the context of your specific question.

### What is the "Sedona Method"?
It is a simple technique of asking yourself a series of questions to release unwanted feelings. By answering "Yes" or "No" (both are okay) and moving through the flow, you often find the feeling dissipates naturally.

### Is my data saved?
No. Your questions and results are transient. Once you refresh the page or click the reset button, the session is cleared.
